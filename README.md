# Digital Cheque

The project introduces a cutting-edge platform that enables users to create, schedule, and 
track digital cheques while ensuring a robust backend system for bank administrators to 
validate and process these transactions efficiently.

# PROBLEM SELECTION
In the modern banking ecosystem, the traditional cheque system remains cumbersome, time
consuming, and prone to errors. Users face challenges in managing cheques, including delays 
in processing, difficulties in tracking their status, and the absence of a digital interface for 
seamless handling. On the other hand, banks struggle with manual verification processes, 
susceptibility to fraudulent activities, and inefficiencies in cheque processing workflows.
